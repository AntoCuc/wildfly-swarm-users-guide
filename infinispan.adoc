= Infinispan

The Infinispan subsystem provides high-performance, clustered, transactional caching. For example, in a clustered web application, client session identifiers and/or data may need to be replicated across all nodes in the cluster. The failure of a session-oriented HTTP request requires that client session data is available on the new failover node. 

To use the Infinispan fraction, just add it to your Swarm Container.

Infinispan is a fairly complex caching system with plenty of knobs and buttons for programmers and administrators to twiddle. For more information on Infinispan and how its runtime configuration may be customized, please also see the https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY9/Infinispan+Subsystem[WildFly documentation] and the official http://infinispan.org/documentation/[Infinispan Documentation].
