= Infinispan

The Infinispan subsystem provides high-performance, clustered, transactional caching. For example, in a clustered web application, client session identifiers and/or data may need to be replicated across all nodes in the cluster. The failure of a session-oriented HTTP request requires that client session data is available on the new failover node. 

The Infinispan subsystem provides the following features:

allows definition and configuration of named cache containers and caches
view run-time metrics associated with cache container and cache instances
In the following sections, we describe the Infinispan subsystem.
