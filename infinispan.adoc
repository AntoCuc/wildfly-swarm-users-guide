= Infinispan

The Infinispan subsystem provides high-performance, clustered, transactional caching. For example, in a clustered web application, client session identifiers and/or data may need to be replicated across all nodes in the cluster. The failure of a session-oriented HTTP request requires that client session data is available on the new failover node. 

The Infinispan subsystem provides the following features:

allows definition and configuration of named cache containers and caches
view run-time metrics associated with cache container and cache instances
In the following sections, we describe the Infinispan subsystem.

Infinispan is a fairly complex caching system with plenty of knobs and buttons for programmers and administrators to twiddle. For more information on Infinispan and how its runtime configuration may be customized, please also see the official http://infinispan.org/documentation/[Infinispan Documentation].
