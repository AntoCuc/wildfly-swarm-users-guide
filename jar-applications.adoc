= JAR Applications

If you desire to move away from traditionally-packaged `.war` applications, more options are available to you with WildFly Swarm.  Though a fluent API, you can fully configure the facilities brought to your application and control what gets deployed.

== Writing your own `main(...)`

When your application is packaged as a `.jar`, you can also (but are not required) to provide your own `main(...)` method. In your `main(...)` you can configure the container as much or as little as you require.  You can also `.deploy(...)` one or more deployments.

The `main(...)` method should exactly match the typical requirements of a main method in Java, and is executable from your IDE.

[source,java]
----
public class Main {

  public static void main(String...args) {
    ..
  }
  
}
----

Within the main method, you can work with the `org.wildfly.swarm.Container` API to configure _fractions_ into the system and deploy components.

The primary methods available are:
