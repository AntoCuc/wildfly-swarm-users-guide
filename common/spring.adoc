= Spring

The Spring Framework is a popular choice for developers that don't want to use Java EE.

WildFly Swarm supports Spring deployments.

== Configuration

To bring Spring functionality to your application, you need the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

If you also require JSON handling, such as returning JSON response documents from a REST interface, you will need the following dependency instead:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-rest</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Usage

The ```spring``` and ```spring-rest``` fractions provide some special handling for Spring applications when used with WildFly Swarm, but they do *not* provide any Spring Framework dependencies transitively.

Whatever Spring Framework dependencies your application currently requires are still necessary within your projects' ```pom.xml```.
