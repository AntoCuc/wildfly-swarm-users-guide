= WAR Applications

If you have an existing WAR-based application, you can construct a self-contained ```-swarm.jar``` from it with ease. By using the plugin of your choice (Maven or Gradle), the resulting uberjar will contain your application along with enough of the application-server to support it.

When building a WAR-based application, you currently can not supply a ```main(...)``` method to launch it.

== Maven

For a Maven project, you already have a ```pom.xml``` with

    <packaging>war</packaging>
    
Simply add configuration for the ```wildfly-swarm-plugin```:

    <build>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
          <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </build>
    
When you perform a typical Maven build using ```mvn package```, your ```target`` directory will include a ```-swarm.jar``` version of your application.

This artifact can then be executed using:

    java -jar ./target/myapp-swarm.jar
