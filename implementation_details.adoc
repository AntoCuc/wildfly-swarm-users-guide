= Implementation Details

This chapter mostly serves as a road-map for users who are curious about the actual inner workings of WildFly Swarm.

== `_myapp_-swarm.jar`

The layout of the generated `_myapp_-swarm.jar` looks roughly like:

`wildfly-swarm.properties` :: File containing the version of WildFly Swarm used in the construction.

`META-INF/wildfly-swarm.properties` :: File containing all user-specified (or default) properties to be used when executing the uberjar.  Examples include:
+
* `jboss.http.port`
* `jboss.bind.address`
* `swarm.logstash.hostname`

`m2repo/` :: Maven-style repository of all jars

`modules/` :: JBoss-Modules tree of `module.xml` files which reference jars by Maven GAV
