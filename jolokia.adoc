= Jolokia

Jolokia is a small utility which provides a JSON-based JMX connector over HTTP.  WildFly Swarm supports a simple method for adding Jolokia to your application.


== Adding Jolokia

To bring Jolokia to your application, you need to add a dependency on the Jolokia fraction:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-jolokia</artifactId>
    </dependency>

This is sufficient to bind an unsecured Jolokia to the context root of ```/jolokia```.

If you would like to configure where Jolokia is mounted, you can override the defaults within your ```main(...)``` method:

    Container container = new Container();
    container.fraction( 
        new JolokiaFraction("/jmx")
    );

The above would make Jolokia available at the path of ```/jmx```.
