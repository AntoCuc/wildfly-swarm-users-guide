= Hawkular


http://www.hawkular.org/[Hawkular] is a monitoring and metrics server from Red Hat. It provides a centralized place for many processes to report their status and internal state.

== Configuration

To add Hawkular support to your application you need the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>hawkular</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Additionally, you need to set at least four pieces of information, which can be set through Java properties or through the API on `HawkularFraction` in order to connect to and authenticate with the Hawkular server.

== Metrics

By default, all reasonably applicable metrics are installed into the Hawkular agent. As with other fractions, you can configure which metrics, availability-checkers, and resource-types you'd like.

Many static constants have been defined to make it easier to mix in the bits you wish to use.

| Description
| Class

| Metrics
| `org.wildfly.swarm.hawkular.Metrics`

| Metric-sets
| `org.wildfly.swarm.hawkular.MetricSets`

| Availability checkers
| `org.wildfly.swarm.hawkular.Avails`

| Avail-sets
| `org.wildfly.swarm.hawkular.AvailSets`

| Resource types
| `org.wildfly.swarm.hawkular.ResourceTypes`

| Resource type sets
| `org.wildfly.swarm.hawkular.ResourceTypeSets`

Of course, additional custom metrics, metric-sets, availability-checkers, avail-sets, resource-types, and resource-type-sets can be created and installed using relevant Java classes.
