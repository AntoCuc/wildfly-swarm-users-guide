= Container

At the root of every WildFly Swarm application is the _container_.

The container provides an API for instantiating an embedded WildFly Swarm container, starting and stopping it, and deploying.

The container can either be instantiated inside your own `main(...)`, or if you don't provide a `main(...)`, then WildFly Swarm will handle the construction of the container and subsequent deployment of your project artifact.

== User-Provided `main(...)`

If you provide a `main(...)` and configure it in <<maven-plugin.adoc#Maven Plugin>>
